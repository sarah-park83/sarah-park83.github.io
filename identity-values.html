                    Few weeks ago, I picked up some cash on the ground. It was approximately $100.
                    When I saw the money, being very honest, I wanted to keep it.
                    However, I soon realised the person who lost the money may be in a serious need of $100 due to poverty, then I also realised that it wasn't my money anyway.
                    So I decided to find the nearest police station and handed the money back to them, in case the person comes and looks for the money.
                    For me, honesty was the highest value out of all. I think this made a huge influence on my behaviour towards the lost money.
                    I'll do the same if I'm get in the same situation in the future, because I want to make sure the person finds their own money.

                <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
                <p>
                    My family has raised me with high values in loyalty, honesty and kindness.
                    They taught me that honesty is always important in life, and also said to me that without honesty, I wouldn't get through anything.
                    I think with this influence, I became who I am now, following what my family has been teaching me my whole life.

                <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
                <p>
                    My strength is that I'm a passionate learner. I love learning new things, especially the ones that I'm interested in.
                    This will have a great impact in my learning journey because at Dev Academy, there are new challenges that I have to face everyday.
                    If I wasn't a passionate learner and easily get distracted by other activities, I wouldn't be able to get through the daily tasks.
                    With my passion, I always thrive to do my best in what I need to do, which I'm sure will help with my journey at Dev Academy!

                <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
                <p>
                    My limitation is that when I get into something, I spend a lot of time on it, sometimes way too much.
                    Throughout my journey at Dev Academy, sometimes I spent more time on a specific task and less on other tasks.
                    So sometimes, I need to go back and reflect back on the tasks that I have spent much less time on, which is very time consuming.
                    I'm practicing my time-management skills so that I spend approximately the same amount of time given in the time box.

                <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
                <p>
                    There was a time when I had to collaborate with others to do a group project.
                    In my group, there was someone who didn't respond very well in the group chat when the team discussion was going on.
                    So, I had to contact him privately and let him know all the details that he missed.
                    Now when I reflect back on the situation, I don't think it was a very good strategy, because that member who didn't respond in the group chat was relying heavily on me to tell him what the others have discussed in the group.
                    In the future when I get in the same situation, I would then ask the person what time is the best time for them to participate in group discussion and set the team discussion at that time if other members can participate then too.
                    I would also tell everyone that it is their own responsibility to participate in the group discussions.
                    The reason for this is because I want everyone to know what their responsibilities are, and how important to be on time as everyone else's times are important as well.
