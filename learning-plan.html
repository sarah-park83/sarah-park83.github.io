        <p>1.   What is your long term goal or career pathway?<br>
            I would like to achieve my long term goal of becoming a software engineering consultant.<br>
        </p>
        <p>2.	A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning<br>
            My strength is that I can focus very well when I start studying/learning something, and my limitation would be that I sometimes put too much stress on myself.<br>
        </p>
        <p>3.	What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            I would like to develop my problem solving skills, because I often don’t know where to begin when I need to solve the problem.</p>
        </p>
        <p>4.	A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<br>
            o	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives<br>
            o	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you<br>
            I will try my best to communicate well with other students and facilitators at Dev Academy. I will always try and manage my time to meet the deadlines/meeting times. If I get into a situation where I cannot meet the deadline or attend the meeting, I will always let the group/facilitator know as soon as possible.<br>
            When things are building up, I will try and relax first. I will let myself know that I’m not the only one struggling, and try not to put much stress on myself. If it continues to build up, I will ask the facilitators/other students for help.<br>
        </p>
        <p>5.	A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way<br>
            I will seek help by connecting with other students or facilitators on discord, before 5pm. If I’m too stressed after 5pm, I’ll take a break to make sure my mental health is ok. If everything settles down, then I’ll continue with the learning with a refreshed brain.<br>
        </p>
        <p> 6.	A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team<br>
            I would like them to always notify us the time of our meeting one day in advance.<br>
        </p>
        <p>7.	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.<br>
            I need to have time to exercise, so I will make sure I can fit that into my schedule.<br>
