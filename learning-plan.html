                <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
                
                <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            
                <p>
                    My long term goal is to become someone who is reliable and consistent.<br>
                    I hope to take away my learning from core learning and use it in my daily life.<br>
                    I've learned how to control my emotions and to think more objectively when I'm making a decision. I've learned that this is a very important velue in life,
                    because when people get controlled over by emotions, they act emotionally and regret it afterwards.<br>
                    I hope to take away the learnings of practicing self-awareness and mindfullness and use them in my life after I grduate from Dev Academy.
                </p>

                <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in bootcamp?</h2>

                <p>
                    I think that my biggest strength will be my eager to learn new things and practice until I get it.<br>
                    My limitation would be that I'm still not used to taking regular breaks throughout my learning.<br>
                    I don't take breaks unless I accomplish my goal, which means that if I get stuck on something,
                    I take a long time to finish it with no breaks.<br><br>
                    Looking back at my foundations learning plan, both my strength and limitation has changed;
                    what my strength was then became my limitation.<br>
                    I focus too much in one problem which leads to spending hours on a simple problem.<br>
                    I do understand that bootcamp is very intense, so hopefully I get more used to taking regular breaks so that I don't get overwhelmed.
                </p>

                <h2>What do you think you biggest non-tecnhincal challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
                <p>
                    My non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be to work in groups.<br>
                    I've had lots of groups projects from highschool to university, and non of them remained as a good memory.<br>
                    There always was someone who never reply to messages nor participate in group meetings. So, I always had to put more effort for my group project.<br>
                    However, I know that Dev Academy is full of passionate people, so I'm really looking forward to work with the people who's got the same passion as me.
                </p>

                <h2>What non-technical skills- human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>

                <p>
                    I would like to be able to control my stress and get over the stressful situation easily.<br>
                    I get stressed a lot when I face a stressful situation and I find it difficult to manage that.<br>
                    I hope to imporve my self-awareness, especially during stressful situations, so that I have a good, reliable relationship with others around me.

                </p>

                <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team</h2>

                <p>
                    I expect a very good communication between the staff members and the students especially during Bootcamp.<br>
                    As Bootcamp is a very intense course, I may face a very difficult time during my learning journey.<br>
                    Then I would start communicating with the Dev Academy staff about my situation, and if there isn't a response back from the staff member,
                    I would start to panic and enhance the difficulty of the situation.
                </p>

                <h2>What are you expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
                <p>
                    FIrstly, I will always make sure that I have at least 8 hours of sleep everyday, so that I can study productively.
                    I will seek help whenever I can and whenever I have to. I will never waste a lot of time on trying to figure out how to solve a problem on my own.
                    I will also make sure that I get enough breaks, so that I don't stress myself out.
                    I will always make sure that I prepare early for my lectures and my due dates. If I cannot make it, then I will let other students/facilitators know in advance.
                    I will make sure that I always try my best with all of my learnings, so that I take in all of the information.
                    Lastly, I will make sure that I practice self-awareness and empathy, so that I don't act towards others with my hard feelings, and interact with them with empathy.
                </p>

                <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>

                <h2>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
                
                <p> 
                    I would like to achieve my long term goal of becoming a software engineering consultant.<br>
                </p>
                
                <h2>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
                
                <p>
                    My strength is that I can focus very well when I start studying/learning something, and my limitation would be that I sometimes put too much stress on myself.
                </p>
                
                <h2>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
                
                <p>
                    I would like to develop my problem solving skills, because I often don’t know where to begin when I need to solve the problem.
                </p>
                
                <h2>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
                <p>
                    o	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives<br>
                    o	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you<br>
                    I will try my best to communicate well with other students and facilitators at Dev Academy. I will always try and manage my time to meet the deadlines/meeting times. If I get into a situation where I cannot meet the deadline or attend the meeting, I will always let the group/facilitator know as soon as possible.<br>
                    When things are building up, I will try and relax first. I will let myself know that I’m not the only one struggling, and try not to put much stress on myself. If it continues to build up, I will ask the facilitators/other students for help.<br>
                </p>

                <h2>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
                
                <p>
                    I will seek help by connecting with other students or facilitators on discord, before 5pm. If I’m too stressed after 5pm, I’ll take a break to make sure my mental health is ok. If everything settles down, then I’ll continue with the learning with a refreshed brain.<br>
                </p>

                <h2>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
                <p>
                    I would like them to always notify us the time of our meeting one day in advance.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
                <p>
                    I need to have time to exercise, so I will make sure I can fit that into my schedule.<br>
