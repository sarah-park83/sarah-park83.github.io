        <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>Neuroplasticity is defined as the ability of the brain to alter its connections or re-wire itself in response to various stimuli. 
            This ability allows the brain to develop further from birth to adulthood and from brain injury, meaning that the brain is able to adapt from experience. 
            There are several benefits associated with neuroplasticity, including the ability to learn new things and enhance cognitive capabilities.
            With this concept, it’s important to have a growth mindset, to understand that everyone can develop further and enhance their abilities. 
            People with a fixed mindset will only see what they can do right now, their fixed abilities. These people will not see how they will develop with the existing abilities they have, and just live on. 
            However, people with a growth mindset will know that they can develop their abilities further and enhance their talents through practice. 
            This can be reflected back on one of the principles of neuroplasticity, “Use it or Lose it”. If people try and explore what they can do with their existing abilities, they will grow further and enhance their own selves. 
            Otherwise, people who don’t use what they have will not be able to access their full abilities, and lose the ability which they could’ve developed further. 
            One of the ways to increase neuroplasticity is to enrich your environment. You can enrich your environment by taking the chance to learn new things, and try what you haven’t done before. 
            This will stimulate positive developments in the brain and result in an increased neuroplasticity.
            </p>

        <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>A growth mindset refers to someone who is not afraid of failure, and always seeks for challenges for growth and enhancement of abilities. 
            Neuroplasticity relies hugely on a growth mindset. Neuroplasticity will not happen if someone is repeating the same things and not exploring new learning environments. 
            This is because if you don’t use your brain’s capability to learn new things, you will eventually lose the ability over time and find it hard to adapt to new learning environments. 
            Someone with a growth mindset will fire chemical changes in brain when they’re learning new things. 
            Through lots of practice, neurons in the brain are able to develop new connections between other neurons, which results in a stronger brain; hence neuroplasticity.<br><br>
            
            During the exploration of neuroplasticity and growth mindset, I’ve realized how important it is to not be scared for failures and always thrive for something new. 
            Now, I’ll try and incorporate the growth mindset into my learning journey by not be scared for failing, because I now know that through lots of failures, I’ll learn a lot and enhance my knowledge.<br>

        <h2>Blend with your Learning Plan and strategies</h2>
        <p>Through learning how neuroplasticity works and how growth mindset helps with it, I would like to use the knowledge and learn new things with a growth mindset. 
            It has influenced me to be more calm when I fail, because I used to not like myself when I couldn’t do something when everyone else can do it. 
            However, now I know that failures help towards my learning, I will always try new things without being afraid of it. 
            I will also practice lots so that my brain fixes in with the new connections that has been made through my new learning.
