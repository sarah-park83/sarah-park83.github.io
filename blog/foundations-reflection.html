                <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned that I get stressed easily over the things I'm not able to do by myself.<br>
                    I love learning new skills but when I get stuck, I spend hours on it to figure it out by myself.<br>
                    I've realised that is a waste of my valuable learning time, so I'll try and ask questions after I've tried to solve the problem for about 30 minutes.<br>
                    I also learned that it is very important to practice mindfullness. With lots of practice, I'm starting to gain more knowledge of how to concentrate on my current surroundings and how to ease my emotions.<br>
                    Lastly, I learned that it's always important to focus what the other person is saying to me. From the listening and looping exercise, I could really feel the connection between me and my partner, which gave me a lot of confidence and a heart warming experience.<br>
                </p>
                <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
                <p>
                    The values play an important role in both learning and programming because these help us to enhance our skills and develop.<br>
                    It helps everyone towards in decision making, which is essential in our everyday lives and also during our learning journey and programming.<br>
                    Empathy is also important to recognise what everyone's feeling and how to interact with those emotions.<br>
                    We all need to interact with various people in our lives, at school, work, home, etc. Without empathy, and understanding of what the other person is feeling/going through right now, it will be very difficult to develop a deep relationship with them.<br>
                    I think that self-awareness plays the most significant role in learning and programming.<br>
                    Some people may be stressed much easily compared to others, or go through a lot of roller-coaster of emotions through out the learning journey.<br>
                    It's really import to be self-aware of what our own emotions are, and make sure our actions don't come from the emotions.<br>
                    This means that we all need to be able to control our emotions so that when it comes to decision making, we are all able to think more obejectively; hence not deciding on something important from our emotions.<br>
                </p>
                <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    I was surpirsed of the importance of practicing mindfullness.<br>
                    Every time I do mindfullness, I'm able to ease my emotions much easier than before from focusing on my surroundings and what my current emotions are.<br>
                    Prior to dev academy, I used to not be able to control my emotions very well because I used to get stressed very often.<br>
                    However, now I'm a lot better at self-awareness of my feelings.
                </p>
                <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    I find thinking like a web developer is the most challenging aspect of the core learning.<br>
                    This is because I still struggle to give myself enough breaks when I get stuck on a problem for hours.<br>
                    I do know that I need breaks thorughout my learning, but I'm always trying to solve everything by myself which gets me into one problem for hours.
                </p>
                <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
                <p>
                    I think this is because it is important to always practice our personal values, empathy and self-awareness.<br>
                    I've gone through an experience during my time at Dev Academy and realised how important all of these are, not only in our daily lives but throughout the learning journey.<br>
                    I find that I learn a lot better now with the learning contents from the core learning.
                </p>
                <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
                <p>
                    No, because I find that the contents in core learning is extremely important.<br>
                    I used to think that the people with best programming skills are the best programmers. However, throughout Dev Academy foundations and studying core learning has helped me to enhance my personal skills and use them for my learning.
                    For example, I used to think that practicing mindfullness is a waste of time. However, after learning about mindfullness and practicing it, it has helped me to know what I'm going though and how to control my emotions<br>
                    I'm a peron who gets stressed a lot when I get stuck. However, I practice mindfullness whenever I get stuck on a problem. This helps me to get over my emotions and re-focus on the problem with a refreshed mind.<br>
                    I do still get stressed a lot over various things, but now I'm a lot better at self-awareness and getting over my emotions.
